### FOSS4G SotM Oceania - Yeah, we know that's a mouthful. Here's what it means.

So let's break it down — 'Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial' or FOSS4G if you're a fan of efficiency (we are) is the name given to the conferences of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo). OSGeo is a non-profit with a mission to foster and promote the adoption of open source geospatial technology. All of this is done within the broader context of open source software philosophy and participatory community driven development.

'State of the Map' or SotM is the conference of the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF) which supports the development of a free and open editable world map. This takes the form of the community driven OpenStreetMap project.

'Oceania' – no acronyms here – This is the part of the world which is quite, well, ocean-y. Think Moana. Technically, Wikipedia tells us it's the geographic region made up of Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. Are you from Oceania? Register now! Not from Oceania? We want you too! Come visit us!

All together now!

FOSS4G SotM Oceania is the regional chapter of the larger global community and the chance to merge the two conferences into one exciting Oceania centered event. We are supported by the OSGeo Foundation (OSGeo) and the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF).

### Who's gonna be there?

Everyone.&#x2020;

*&#x2020; almost everyone.*

This conference is aimed at a broad swath of the community – developers, users, contributors, community mappers, academics, business, government and anyone interested in open source geospatial software and the OpenStreetMap project.

This is your chance to connect with developers creating the next generation of geospatial technology. Get ahead of the curve and find out what's on the horizon.  FOSS4G and State of the Map events attract a very diverse audience on the global stage – so strap in for amazing content.

### Why should I go?

You'll learn about cutting edge tech and what's on the horizon, meet the experts and talk to them, and learn new skills. Get the chance to hear what others like yourself are doing and producing with their open source geospatial tools.  Along the way you'll meet up with old friends, make new ones, and share your experiences.

On a practical note, this is the best bang for buck training around. It's worth thousands and costs – only hundreds. Comparable formal training courses will cost you so much more – and no amount of money can buy the motivation and feel good vibes you will get from this experience.  This conference will open up a whole world of free and open source possibilities to you.
