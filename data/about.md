### FOSS4G SotM Oceania - Yeah, we know that's a mouthful. Here's what it means.

So let's break it down — 'Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial' or FOSS4G if you're a fan of efficiency (we are) is the name given to the conferences of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo). OSGeo is a non-profit with a mission to foster and promote the adoption of open source geospatial technology. All of this is done within the broader context of open source software philosophy and participatory community driven development.

'State of the Map' or SotM is the conference of the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF) which supports the development of a free and open editable world map. This takes the form of the community driven OpenStreetMap project.

'Oceania' – no acronyms here – This is the part of the world which is quite, well, ocean-y. Think Moana. Technically, Wikipedia tells us it's the geographic region made up of Australasia, Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. Are you from Oceania? Register now! Not from Oceania? We want you too! Come visit us!

All together now!

FOSS4G SotM Oceania is the regional chapter of the larger global community and the chance to merge the two conferences into one exciting Oceania centered event. We are supported by the OSGeo Foundation (OSGeo) and the OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF).

### What can I expect?

FOSS4G SotM Oceania belongs to you!  It's the chance to come together as a community for 4 days to share knowledge and experience through technical workshops, conference sessions, social events, and a community day. The topics will be wide ranging and the attendees will be users, creators, business, academics, community mappers, government, and your kids.&#42;

Day one is the technical workshops – here you will learn from experts and get hands-on training. You'll get the chance to meet and connect with your community of users and developers – you can forge friendships and professional connections with like-minded people all in one go!

Days two and three are the conference - you'll hear from the leaders of the community, from the developers of your favourite projects, and experience of users. The conference is split between FOSS4G and SotM content and topics, you will find that they complement each other well.

If you're curious check out [last years presentations](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbqmnF77HxLCmO9d7LrEbpg/videos) from the first FOSS4G SotM Oceania held in Melbourne. While you're at it have a look at the list of [hands-on workshops](https://2018.foss4g-oceania.org/program/workshops.html). Are you getting excited yet? Do you have a story you want to share?

Day four is the 'Community day' – your chance to give back and get your hands dirty taking part in a code sprint and a mapathon. With everyone in the same space – we'll pool our resources and all figure out ways to contribute. Yes, we can all help!

*&ast; FOSS4G SotM Oceania is a child-friendly conference.*

### Who's gonna be there?

Everyone.&#x2020;

This conference is aimed at a broad swath of the community – developers, users, contributors, community mappers, academics, business, government and anyone interested in open source geospatial software and the OpenStreetMap project.

This is your chance to connect with developers creating the next generation of geospatial technology. Get ahead of the curve and find out what's on the horizon.  FOSS4G and State of the Map events attract a very diverse audience on the global stage – so strap in for amazing content.

*&#x2020; almost everyone.*

### Why should I go?

You'll learn about cutting edge tech and what's on the horizon, meet the experts and talk to them, and learn new skills. Get the chance to hear what others like yourself are doing and producing with their open source geospatial tools.  Along the way you'll meet up with old friends, make new ones, and share your experiences.

### Why should my manager send me?

We live in a fast paced open world and your manager needs you to stay on top of the latest developments in open source and open data. Sending you to FOSS4G SotM Oceania 2019 will enable you to become an innovation agent for your enterprise. If you're working with open source geospatial software and open data, this is the ideal information and learning event!

On a practical note, this is the best bang for buck training around. It's worth thousands and costs – only hundreds. Comparable formal training courses will cost you so much more – and no amount of money can buy the motivation and feel good vibes you will get from this experience.  This conference will open up a whole world of free and open source possibilities to you.  Pun intended.

### Why should I sponsor?

The short version: you'll have direct exposure to the people in this community, both during the conference and informally at the social events. Sponsoring this event will give you a marketing presence, but also show your willingness to give back to this important global community. You'll support ongoing development of free, open, democratised geospatial tools which have become part of critical geospatial infrastructure.

Your sponsorship enables us to set fair ticket prices and support attendees travelling long distances or those with other needs requiring support. Our community is diverse and inclusive - sponsorship funding directly empowers us to help others.

The longer version: check out our Sponsors page [here](/sponsor/).

### Who runs FOSS4G SotM Oceania?

In line with the ethos of the OSGeo and OpenStreetMap communities, the conference is organised by a group of passionate volunteers all who are experienced geospatial practitioners and community mappers committed to the goals of both their respective international foundations.
