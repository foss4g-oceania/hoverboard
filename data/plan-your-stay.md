## Plan your stay

### Visas

Australian citizens do not require a New Zealand Electronic Travel Advisory (NZeTA) or a visa.

An [NZeTA](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/about-visa/nzeta) is required for citizens of [visa waiver countries](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/about-visa/nzeta#https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/tools-and-information/general-information/visa-waiver-countries/slider), which includes USA, Canada and most European countries.

A visa will be required for citizens of remaining countries, including the majority of international visitors from the Pacific Islands. Immigration New Zealand has information regarding [visa options](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/options/visit/explore-visitor-visa-options). Contact [admin@foss4g-oceania.org](mailto:admin@foss4g-oceania.org) should you require any assistance or documentation for your visa process.

### Accommodation

There are a range of accommodation options close to our venues - this list contains a few recommendations. Wellington has a compact and walkable CBD, and there are certainly other options further afield that may provide better value and still allow easy access. [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.co.nz/s/New_Zealand--Wellington/) is another economical option with plenty of listed properties close by.

### Public Transport

**Around Town**

Wellington is very walkable from the conference venue, and many of the sightseeing, museum, shopping and restaurant options can be accessed by foot.

[Metlink](https://www.metlink.org.nz/) is Wellington's public transport network - including buses, suburban trains and a harbour ferry. Regular bus users will use a [Snapper card](https://www.metlink.org.nz/tickets-and-fares/snapper-for-buses/) but you can still also purchase a ticket from the driver.

[JUMP](https://nz.jump.com/nz/en/cities/wellington/) and [Flamingo](https://flamingoscooters.com/) electronic scooters are available for hire and [Onzo](https://onzo.co.nz/) operates a dockless bike share service. Ride sharing services include [Zoomy](https://zoomy.co.nz/) and [Uber](https://www.uber.com/nz/en/).

**Airport Transfers**

The [Airport Flyer](https://www.nzbus.co.nz/airportflyer/home) bus service travels between Wellington Airport and Wellington Railway Station (close to our venues and the accommodation listed above) every 10mins during peak times, otherwise every 20mins. Tickets cost $12 and can be purchased using cash / eftpos / credit card from the driver.

[Super Shuttle](www.supershuttle.co.nz) and a number of taxi companies also service the airport. Shuttles start at around $20, while a taxi ride will be $30-40.


### Restaurants and Cafes

[Neat Places](https://neatplaces.co.nz/places/wellington) has a great list of local favourites - but don't miss our Icebreaker and Conference Dinner!


### Sightseeing

**Te Papa Tongawera: Museum of New Zealand** (Free)

Visit NZ’s national museum, [Te Papa](https://www.tepapa.govt.nz/), located on the waterfront, an easy walk from the conference venue.
There are a variety of art, science, nature and historical exhibits. [*Gallipoli: The scale of Our War*](https://www.tepapa.govt.nz/visit/exhibitions/gallipoli-scale-our-war) is a ground-breaking exhibition that tells the story of the eight month Gallipoli campaign through the eyes of eight ordinary New Zealanders. Each has been sculpted at 2.4x human size by Weta Workshop. [*Te Taiao*](https://www.tepapa.govt.nz/visit/exhibitions/te-taiao-nature) is the brand new permanent nature exhibition, featuring an earthquake simulation and the only Collosal Squid specimen on display in the world.

**Oriental Bay** (Free)

Want time to just relax on the beach? Walk down to Wellington’s Oriental Bay further along the waterfront and enjoy a dip in the water, some sun on the sand, or a coffee from a nearby cafe. Located about 1km from the conference venue.

![oriental_bay](/images/sightseeing/orientalbay.jpg)

**Zealandia** ($21)

Take a walk into one of Wellington’s natural area jewels: [Zealandia](https://www.visitzealandia.com/) eco-sanctuary, home to some of New Zealand's most rare and extraordinary wildlife. A free shuttle will take you there from the city centre’s i-Site visitor centre.

![zealandia](/images/sightseeing/zealandia.jpg)

**Mount Victoria** (Free)

If weather is good, don’t miss a walk up Mount Victoria, the hill closest to the city centre, for a 360 degree view of the city, Wellington harbour, and surrounding south coast. Using [this online mobile friendly map](https://jducnuigeen.github.io/foss4gwellington2019_MtVic.github.io/#15/-41.2867/174.7862) (built with Leaflet and open data from LINZ of course) you can follow the red line from the conference venue along the waterfront up to the top of the hill, approximately a 4.5km walk one way. There will likely be a group run scheduled to do the same route, during one of the conference days or on the community day.

![mt_vic](/images/sightseeing/mtvic.jpg)

**Wellington Cable Car** ($5 one way, $9 return)

For over a hundred years passengers on the [Wellington Cable Car](https://www.wellingtoncablecar.co.nz/) have enjoyed the dramatic views of the Wellington cityscape and surrounding hills that define Wellington's harbour. At the top, there is the Cable Car Museum (free), Space Place at Carter Observatory ($14) and the Wellington Botanic Gardens. A walk downhill through the gardens can take you back to the city.

We really hope you enjoy your time in Wellington.
