### Announcing the results of our Travel Grant Program

The FOSS4G SotM Oceania Travel Grant Program is in its second year and going strong. In 2018, we helped 7 people from around the region attend the event in Melbourne. Based on last year's success, we've grown the TGP to include more grants and higher levels of support.

We're very pleased to announce the results of our 2019 TGP! We were very impressed by the calibre of the applicants, and we had to make some hard decisions, but we've ended up with a wonderful cohort of grantees:

- Emily Hurry (Australia)
- Kamsin Raju (Fiji)
- Nick Rollings (Fiji)
- Carrol Chan (Fiji)
- Vasiti Soko (Fiji)
- Violaine Doutreleau (French Polynesia)
- Gavin Bare (New Zealand)
- Elisa Puccioni (New Zealand)
- Bradley Eichelberger (Northern Mariana Islands)
- Joeli Varo (Papua New Guinea)
- Ebony-Jean Ta'avili (Samoa)

By helping these people attend FOSS4G SotM Oceania, we're helping grow the open geospatial community across the Oceania region. These 13 people will bring their unique perspectives to the event, enriching the experience for all of us, and they'll take their learnings back to their communities, sharing the enthusiasm far and wide.

Thanks to our TGP working group (John Bryant, Greg Lauer, Jonah Sullivan, David Garcia, and Kim Fitter) for securing funding, and ensuring a smooth and fair process. Also, thanks to these people who joined our Selection Panel: Dorothy Pion, Nimalika Fernando, Vika Fane, and Conway Pene. Kim, Dorothy, Nimalika, and Fane were TGP grant recipients in 2018, and bring their unique experience to the selection process.

The TGP is made possible by financial support from [OSGeo Oceania](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Oceania), the international [OSGeo Foundation](https://www.osgeo.org/), individual contributors, and sponsors. We're always looking for more support to continue to grow the TGP, there are many people out there who could benefit from this program.
