FOSS4G conferences have a tradition of hosting a community day/code sprint after the conference. State of the Map conferences have similar traditions, often including an OpenStreetMap mapathon. Our community day is open to everyone from novice to expert. It is a melting pot of ideas where project insiders meet users and each helps the other. There’s always plenty to do – it’s not only about programming and/or street-mapping.

Here are some ideas for topics that you can get involved with:
- Humanitarian mapping/Missing Maps event
- Testing, improving instructional documentation and translations
- Improving features in software and/or identifying and debugging glitches
- Local mapping/improving OpenStreetMap
- Data visualisation
- Discovering the breadth of tools in the FOSS4G and OpenStreetMap ecosystems

The Community Day will be held Friday 15th of November at Rutherford House (corner of Lambton Quay and Bunny Street), part of Victoria University of Wellington, which is only a few minutes walk away from the main conference location. We will be starting at 9am and finishing at 5pm, with catering provided.

Registration at the conference is not a prerequisite for participation in the Community Day. Participation in the Community Day is free of charge and all folks interested in giving back to geospatial open source and open data communities are welcome.

### How is the *Community Day* (Friday Nov 15th) different from the *Workshop Day* (Tuesday Nov 12th)?

The Community Day is a free, informal event led by participants with shared interests in a particular topic. The emphasis of the day is to give inspired individuals a chance to meet and share their open geospatial knowledge, such as sharing code, troubleshooting problems, or helping beginners tackle problems they have encountered.

Workshops are structured events led by one or more instructors to learn specific tasks or to teach specific skills. Workshops require registration and cost $100 per half day. There is a limited number of places for each workshop.

If you are interested in leading a community day event, send us an email with your thoughts to [community@foss4g-oceania.org](mailto:community@foss4g-oceania.org).
