### What can I expect?

FOSS4G SotM Oceania belongs to you!  It's the chance to come together as a community for four days to share knowledge and experience through technical workshops, conference sessions, social events, and a community day. The topics will be wide ranging and the attendees will be users, creators, business, academics, community mappers, government, and your kids (this is a child-friendly conference).

Day one is technical workshops – here you will learn from experts and get hands-on training. You'll get the chance to meet and connect with your community of users and developers – you can forge friendships and professional connections with like-minded people all in one go!

Days two and three are the conference - you'll hear from the leaders of the community, the developers of your favourite projects, and experiences of users. The conference is split between FOSS4G and SotM content and topics, you will find that they complement each other well.

Day four is the 'Community day' – your chance to give back and get your hands dirty taking part in a code sprint and a mapathon. With everyone in the same space – we'll pool our resources and all figure out ways to contribute. Yes, we can all help!
