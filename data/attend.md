### What can I expect?

FOSS4G SotM Oceania belongs to you!  It's the chance to come together as a community for four days to share knowledge and experience through technical workshops, conference sessions, social events, and a community day. The topics will be wide ranging and the attendees will be users, creators, business, academics, community mappers, government, and your kids (this is a child-friendly conference).

Day one is technical workshops – here you will learn from experts and get hands-on training. You'll get the chance to meet and connect with your community of users and developers – you can forge friendships and professional connections with like-minded people all in one go!

Days two and three are the conference - you'll hear from the leaders of the community, the developers of your favourite projects, and experiences of users. The conference is split between FOSS4G and SotM content and topics, you will find that they complement each other well.

Day four is the 'Community day' – your chance to give back and get your hands dirty taking part in a code sprint and a mapathon. With everyone in the same space – we'll pool our resources and all figure out ways to contribute. Yes, we can all help!

If you're curious check out [last years presentations](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbqmnF77HxLCmO9d7LrEbpg/videos) from the first FOSS4G SotM Oceania held in Melbourne. While you're at it have a look at the list of [hands-on workshops](https://2018.foss4g-oceania.org/program/workshops.html). Are you getting excited yet? Do you have a story you want to share?

### Who's gonna be there?

Everyone.&#x2020;

*&#x2020; almost everyone.*

This conference is aimed at a broad swath of the community – developers, users, contributors, community mappers, academics, business, government and anyone interested in open source geospatial software and the OpenStreetMap project.

This is your chance to connect with developers creating the next generation of geospatial technology. Get ahead of the curve and find out what's on the horizon.  FOSS4G and State of the Map events attract a very diverse audience on the global stage – so strap in for amazing content.

### Why should I go?

You'll learn about cutting edge tech and what's on the horizon, meet the experts and talk to them, and learn new skills. Get the chance to hear what others like yourself are doing and producing with their open source geospatial tools.  Along the way you'll meet up with old friends, make new ones, and share your experiences.

On a practical note, this is the best bang for buck training around. It's worth thousands and costs – only hundreds. Comparable formal training courses will cost you so much more – and no amount of money can buy the motivation and feel good vibes you will get from this experience.  This conference will open up a whole world of free and open source possibilities to you.
