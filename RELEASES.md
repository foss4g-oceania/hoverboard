# FOSS4G-Oceania releases

## Prerequisites

You need to get `.firebaserc`, `serviceAccount.dev.json` and `serviceAccount.prod.json` from Google Drive. Do not share these. Do not commit them (they are in .gitignore to prevent this happening accidentally). If these are shared or committed, let Richard know ASAP and new credentials will be generated. Place these files in the root directory of this project.

You need to install npm.

You need to install firebase-tools: `npm install -g firebase-tools`. This shouldn't require super user permissions; if it does I recommend spending a few minutes addressing that separately.

## Deployment

In the following commands, substitute `{stage}` with the appropriate stage: `dev` or `prod`.

If you make changes to any of the Markdown documents or JSON files, to deploy these changes:

`npm run firestore:init:{stage}`

This will prompt for a `y` or `n` input to proceed: verify that you're deploying to the correct stage before continuing.

If you make changes to any of the Polymer (HTML/CSS/JS) components:

`npm run deploy:{stage}`

In practice, and if in doubt, simply run both commands as they are quite harmless, particularly if you deploy to `dev`, confirm that the change works without breaking existing functionality, and then deploy to `prod`.

If deployment issues arise, we can further develop our release practices (e.g. versioning, Github releases), but until then: YAGNI.
