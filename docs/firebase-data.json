This session will be run by certified RPA pilots and operate in accordance with CAANZ’s Part 101 regulations. It will cover flight planning for different data collection goals, and walk through some different flight scenarios\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, we’ll crunch numbers. This  session will walk users through OpenDroneMap, and we’ll discuss and demonstrate other useful tools - QGIS, CloudCompare, PDAL, and Entwine. \r\n\r\nThis is aimed at an intermediate audience - covering a broad range of topics rather than a deep dive into a specific technology.

Liquefaction induced by tectonism is lethal and deadly which summons the need for forward risks reduction planning. It is one of the geohazards associated with seismic ground shaking or tremor which result in collapsing of buildings, loss of human lives and environmental disturbances. Numerous procedures were employed to identify potential liquefaction zones. The present study aims at assessing the site-soil geology of Viti Levu Island using the GIS and remote sensing techniques. Site-soil geology, geomorphology and SRTM DEM data were the main sources of layers used to carry out analysis using the Saaty’s Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and ArcGIS Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA).In the ArcGIS 10.5 spatial analyst tool, the raster calculator, reclassify and weightage overlay tools were mainly employed in the study. The final output of LPZ indicates the ‘low’, ‘moderate’, ‘high’ and ‘very high’ zones for spatial planners and decision makers to formulate policies. Thus, enhancing the preventative measures in order to pro-active rather been re-active in spatial physical planning.",

With applications from visualising IoT data through to ingesting drone footage, it brings with it increasingly large data sizes, complicated data pipelines, HPC-level transformation demands, and often massive traffic from public users. From Smart Cities through to location-based marketing, rapid analysis of large volumes of geospatial data is becoming increasingly important. In this session you will hear how AWS customers build powerful, flexible, secure, and future-proof geospatial platforms. These systems deliver more business value from location-based data while minimising both compute costs and management overhead.",

I have been running QGIS workshops for geologists in association with the Australian Institute of Geoscientists since 2016 and I will highlight the QGIS features most valued by geologists. Geologists require the ability to assess multiple data sets and QGIS gives them the ability to do this. Being able to bring satellite imagery directly into your map window has been a major advance in the interpretation of geological data. Plugins allow for remote sensing data to be sourced, processed and presented as required by the user. Other plugins allow drill holes to be plotted in plan and in cross section. The use of free open source symbols and patterns has extended the capabilities of geologist to produce presentation quality maps. Many geologists work as individual consultants or contractors and the open source world is a fantastic resource of software to allow them to do their work without the constricting licensing conditions or software costs.",

By integrating SBT and ICT tool, with national disaster risk management architecture, timely and accurate information can be delivered to relevant communities, individual, rescuers and decision makers to save lives and properties at risk. The project was funded by Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, with technical assistance from the Japan aerospace exploration agency, Asia Institute of Technology – Geomatics Centre, Asian Disaster Reduction Centre, Remote Sensing technology centre and Geothings.  Work carried out was divided into 5 sections\r\n1.\tLocal communities digitised building and infrastructure in Open Street Map\r\n2.\tLocal communities with assistance from mobile app developer design a base map to fit the purpose of the project. These include building attributes, conditions, height and materials. \r\n3.\tRecording capacities – Using geoBinAn App, disaster capacities and vulnerability are identified and mapped out in real time. Communities’ hazard maps were generated out of this work. \r\n4.\tRecording - During disaster users can record information including disaster situation, building damage, and needs assessments.  This information is sent to the operation centre for assistance - all these in real time. \r\n5.\tEmergency Observation - Using satellite data, and community base map – it was possible to estimate damage extents. \r\nLocal communities were trained to use the tools to record vulnerability and capacities in village related to floods, and cyclone. All these tools and reports are updated on the website monitored by the NDMO Operation centre. Two critical maps came out of this work: 1. Community-based hazard map and 2. Evacuation map.   These are the base map used for the village to seek shelter and identify hazard areas and planning.",

      "description": "Geoscience Australia (GA) is the custodian of a significant collection of national aerial photography, curated by GA and its predecessor agencies. The data extends over 70 years, from the 1920s through to the mid-1990s. This archive represents an important resource for understanding Australia’s changing landscape as the majority of the collection predates high resolution satellite imagery.\r\n\r\nDigitisation of this archive is an ongoing priority as some of the original negatives are now very old and starting to degrade; but the approximately 280,000 images digitised so far are currently difficult to discover and access.\r\n\r\nSimilar but smaller archives of aerial photography are maintained by various state government agencies, and some are quite mature in their adoption of digital discovery and access, however each agency has implemented their own system, generally locked to a proprietary platform with little capacity for federating data across agencies.\r\n\r\nGA has therefore partnered with Data-61 under the Platforms for Open Data (PfOD) program to design and build a canonical metadata repository for images in the collection, and an open API for discovering and eventually accessing these images.  The project has a strong focus on open source and standards based solutions, with the hope that state government agencies will come on board, facilitating federated discovery of imagery across state and federally managed archives.\r\n\r\nThe project is a fascinating example of old technology meeting new, dealing with metadata sourced from nearly century-old hand-written documents on the one hand, and the latest cloud deployment technologies and emerging API standards for geospatial data discovery on the other.",

      "description": "AWS Ground Station is a fully managed service that lets you control satellite communications, downlink and process satellite data, and scale your satellite operations quickly, easily and cost-effectively without having to worry about building or managing your own ground station infrastructure. Ground stations are at the core of global satellite networks, which are facilities that provide communications between the ground and the satellites by using antennas to receive data and control systems to send radio signals to command and control the satellite. Today, you must either build your own ground stations and antennas, or obtain long-term leases with ground station providers, often in multiple countries to provide enough opportunities to contact the satellites as they orbit the globe. Once all this data is downloaded, you need servers, storage, and networking in close proximity to the antennas to process, store, and transport the data from the satellites.\r\nAWS Ground Station eliminates these problems by delivering a global Ground Station as a Service. We provide direct access to AWS services and the AWS Global Infrastructure including our low-latency global fiber network right where your data is downloaded into our AWS Ground Station. This enables you to control satellite communications, ingest and process your satellite data, and integrate that data with your applications and services running in the AWS Cloud. For example, you can use Amazon S3 to store downloaded data, Amazon SageMaker for building custom machine learning applications, and Amazon EC2 to command and download data from satellites.",

      "description": "The Fiji Geodetic Datum (FGD) 1986 on WGS 72 ellipsoid is the official datum and has been\r\nused to date. FGD 1986 later adopted the name Fiji Map Grid (FMG) 1986 (Hannah, J. and\r\nMaseyk, J, 1989). This is about to change with the recent installation of 8 continuously operating\r\nreference station (CORs) station that will generate a network Real Time Kinematic (RTK)\r\nsolution across the islands, which will lead to the definition of a new geodetic datum. These\r\nchanges will have an impact on geospatial datasets. GIS is an evolving science that is\r\nconstantly being challenged by new technologies. In particular, access to high precision\r\nnavigation and positioning is an important development that will impact GIS users. The recent\r\nannouncement for the development of a sovereign satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS)\r\nin Australia will allow access to centimetre (cm) precision for all users using any device. In Fiji,\r\nSpatial datasets are referenced to two main coordinate systems: WGS 84 UTM Zone 60s and\r\nFiji Map Grid 1986. With precision surveying becoming a reality, users’ will need to understand\r\nthat WGS 84 should not be considered a one size fit all datum (Qiao, 2014 and Brunner,F\r\n1998). Geoscience Australia (2017) stated that Australian are not able to achieve better\r\naccuracies as they cannot access WGS84 via a differential measurement directly to the DoD\r\nnetwork of stations. WGS84 coordinate accuracy is meaningless unless epoch metadata are\r\nprovided. This and others are the reason why Fiji is updating its national datum. Geoscience\r\nAustralia in 2005 conducted a GNSS survey for Fiji’s maritime boundary. The coordinates for all\r\nthese survey marks were transformed from FMG 1986 to ITRF 2005. Part of my research, I\r\nupdated the ITRF 2005 to the latest reference frame (ITRF 2014), adopted a set of codes from\r\nGeographic Information Systems Stack Exchange (2015) and transform the coordinates using\r\nHelmert transformation parameters in order to map movement that has occurred on the survey\r\nmark which will indicate movements in the tectonic plates. These movements are then \r\ncalculated and incorporated into a distortion model in QGIS.",
