An easier approach is using TerriaJS as your UI to interact with CesiumJS. This workshop will show you how easy that is to do!\n\n## Details\n\nTerriaJS builds upon CesiumJS’ 3D web geospatial visualization, adding a UI for exploring and previewing layers in a catalog, charts and graphs, a “splitter” interactive comparison tool, shareable story building and many other features. In this workshop, you will learn how to build and deploy a rich and compelling TerriaJS application, without writing any code. You will also learn how to extend TerriaJS with custom functionality as your application’s needs grow.\n\n### Skill level\n\n**Beginner/Introductory**\n\nSome experience with JavaScript/NodeJS would be advantageous.

      "description": "The workshop will include a brief overview of SOS (the OGC's Sensor Observation Service), and NIWA's Sensor Observation Services, to provide context, followed by the hands on workshop.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will take you through accessing a SOS service (using NIWA's as an example) using R on your own laptop to request specified data from the service, and how you can develop a simple R Shiny web application based on this.\n\n## Details\n\nSOS is becoming the global standard API for sensor (time series) data sharing. NIWA has deployed SOS services providing free public access to monthly climate data summaries, hydrometric and water quality data. The 52 North open source SOS Server application has been used for this. Custom NIWA middleware sits between our underlying databases and the 52 North software, so the system sits alongside our existing databases, simply adding a new mechanism for accessing the data.\r\n\r\nNIWA has also developed client tools which users can use to access these services (yes, you can still use CURL if you choose). One is a custom QGIS plugin, which allows users to connect to a SOS service much as they can a WMS or WFS service. The sites of stations providing observations can be shown on the map, and available sensor data graphed and downloaded as required.\r\n\r\nThe second SOS client is a new SOS4R package, for the R statistical software program. This package provides two sets of capabilities: It can issue SOS requests and return data into local dataframes, but, and more usefully, it also supports a set of abstracted queries, built on top of the native SOS requests, which provides additional requests much more suited to how a user would want to interact with the service - a much more user friendly workflow. \r\n\r\nAn R user can use this package to access a SOS service to request data to analyse locally, or as the data access tool for an R Shiny web application allowing others to interact with the service.\r\n\r\nIn R you will learn how to:\r\n\r\nGet a list of sites (stations) which provide data (and which sites provide a specifies reading)\r\nGet a list of what datasets (instrument readings) are available (and filtered by site)\r\nFilter data requests by date/time\r\nRequest a dataset for a selected instrument from a site within a specified time period\r\nPlot these data  \r\n\r\nIn Shiny, you will build a simple web site allowing users to view stations on a map, select a station, a reading , a time extent and download/plot the data.\n\n### Skill level\n\n**Intermediate**\n\nYou will need to be very comfortable writing R scripts for all parts of the workshop. Ideally, use R Studio as the IDE, as this works well with R & Shiny and allows you to easily publish your Shiny application on the web on their Shiny server. \r\n\r\nFamiliarity with developing Shiny applications and using Leaflet for embedded maps will be useful for the Shiny part of the workshop.\n\n### Things to bring and stuff to do beforehand\n\nYour own laptop with R & RStudio set up for use.",

      "description": "Pattern matters! What is the most efficient way of allocating a limited amount of water or fertiliser across several paddocks? What is the best spatial land-use configuration to minimise environmental impact in a catchment? More generally, what is the best way of allocating a set of potentially limited resources to a set of locations or areas to get the best bang for your buck? If you are grappling with these types of questions, this workshop is for you! We will guide you step by step through the process of structuring, solving, and mapping spatial optimisation problems using the free and open source spatial modelling and optimisation framework [LUMASS](https://bitbucket.org/landcareresearch/lumass/wiki/Home). Apart from basic GIS skills, we only expect your enthusiasm! Note: Linux or Windows laptop required!\n\n## Details\n\n#### Workshop Content\r\nIn this half-day workshop (WS), we provide a practical introduction to spatial optimisation (SO). At the beginning (30 mins.), we will provide a short overview of \r\n\r\n* the types of SO problems you can solve with [LUMASS](https://bitbucket.org/landcareresearch/lumass/wiki/Home)\r\n\r\n* what data you need to solve SO problems \r\n\r\n* and how to prepare and structure your data for solving SO problems with [LUMASS](https://bitbucket.org/landcareresearch/lumass/wiki/Home).\r\n\r\nIn the remainder of the WS (3h), you will be working through the [LUMASS](https://bitbucket.org/landcareresearch/lumass/wiki/Home) [OptimisationHowTo](https://bitbucket.org/landcareresearch/lumass/downloads/OptimisationHowTo_1.2.zip) to replicate the SO scenarios as published in [Herzig et al. (2018)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.05.005). You can either work completely by yourself and follow the document step by step and ask for assistance if required; or you can follow short demonstrations showing the next set of steps on the screen and then reproduce them on your laptop and then follow the demo of the next set of steps etc. There will be extra tasks for those who complete the [HowTo](https://bitbucket.org/landcareresearch/lumass/downloads/OptimisationHowTo_1.2.zip) before the end of the WS. \r\nIf you are a Linux user, please make sure to download the [source code](https://bitbucket.org/landcareresearch/lumass/src/master/) and [compile](https://bitbucket.org/landcareresearch/lumass/src/master/INSTALL) LUMASS on your machine prior to the workshop (don’t leave it to the last minute)!

This workshop will introduce you to the Open Data Cube, the Jupyter data science environment, and analysis ready data in a live coding environment, the DEA Sandbox.\n\n## Details\n\nThe Open Data Cube (ODC) is a collaborative effort to develop software and a community of users around a common goal of increasing the ease of access to Earth observation data. The increase in the number of Earth observing satellites over the past few years, coupled with new open data policies and new storage formats like Cloud Optimised GeoTIFF, means that there is a need for a standard way to plug in to this data and enable analysis processes. The ODC provides this way. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will introduce you to Digital Earth Australia’s (DEA) implementation of the ODC, the DEA Sandbox, and through the use of the Sandbox, you’ll work through a suite of examples that show you what the ODC can do and what data DEA make available for Australia. This workshop will cover the following topics:\r\n* What is analysis ready data\r\n* What is Jupyter and how can I use it \r\n* Using simple Jupyter apps to explore data \r\n* Do-it-yourself example implementing NDVI from scratch\r\n* Advanced example using Landsat 8 optical data to identify coastlines over time \r\n* Advanced example using Sentinel 1 radar data to identify water.\n\n### Skill level\n\n**Intermediate**\n\nSome Python programming experience is required as this workshop involves some hands-on coding.\n\n### Things to bring and stuff to do beforehand\n\nAttendees are required to bring a laptop with a modern web browser, preferably Google Chrome.\r\n\r\nWe require Internet access for the workshop participants.",

All without having to worry about all that techie hosting/databases/cloud stuff that can just be overwhelming?\r\n\r\nYes? Then this workshop is for you! You’ll find out what’s involved in creating your own self-hosted web map. (Without needing years of experience in software development to understand the process.)\n\n## Details\n\nYou may have heard about new technologies like vector tiles, that let you make huge and complex data available as a web map, or those cloud services run by Amazon, or looked at the amazing services from Mapbox, but been nervous about what it would cost if your map suddenly got a lot of attention. Well, you don’t need any of those!\r\n\r\nWe’ll be using vector tiles to build a web map that you can upload to any web hosting service – from the cheapest shared web host to a WordPress site. No complex pay-per-month cloud services, no spatial web servers, and no databases - just a simple map that’s yours to own.\r\n\r\nThis workshop isn’t about learning to code, learning QGIS, or learning about data – it’s about putting those components together to achieve something bigger. We'll be walking you through the whole process of making the technology work for you step-by-step.\r\n\r\nFirst, we'll take open data published by the New Zealand government and use it to create vector tiles. (Vector tiles are a neat new way to package up data in a way that’s ideally suited to web maps.) Then we’ll use Mapbox Studio to design a snazzy looking map with our data. Finally, we'll upload it to your very own website and share it with the world.\r\n\r\nThe maps we’ll be creating are ideal for those times you want to make a map that you can just upload and forget about. They're perfect for student projects, company websites, or for cartographers and designers who want to craft beautiful customised maps that are easy to hand over to clients.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will provide you with the knowledge you need to get started, but you're free to deviate from the examples that we provide as you grow more confident and start to explore the tools available to you.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to seeing your creations!\r\n\r\nImage: NZ Topo50 Map series from LINZ.

These simple data overlays can be extended to an integrated analysis with the road network for deeper insight - like accident hotspots on road segments that bottleneck commuter flows. As denizens of a city we primarily interact with the built urban environment via its streets, roads and paths. Hence, intuitive questions of the 'Urban Experience' must involve the geospatial road network.\n\n## Details\n\nIn this workshop, we'll use Python and the packages, osmnx and pandana, to characterise Wellington: the cool little capital of New Zealand with a unique topography. Using omsnx, pandana and data of the built environment (from OpenStreetMap and Wellington City Council open data), we can quantify how Wellington functions as a city.\r\n\r\nFoundational topics include:\r\n\r\n- Handling geospatial data with geopandas\r\n- Getting street networks with osmnx\r\n- Routing with network algorithms\r\n- Calculating flows from routes\r\n\r\nUrban analysis topics include:\r\n\r\n- Analysing street morphology and topography with osmnx\r\n- Accessibility analysis with pandana\r\n- Catchment areas of amenities with pandana\n\n### Skill level\n\n**Intermediate**\n\nParticipants will need to have some experience with Python programming to finish the exercises.

After a quick guide to launching up PyGMT on your computer, we will start with the basics of making your first map with PyGMT and explore some different customizations such as fancy projection systems and colormaps. Next we will teach you how to load in CSV point and GeoTIFF/NetCDF grid datasets using [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) and [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray), and have PyGMT perform more advanced geoprocessing workflows such as sampling, filtering and interpolation on them. Finally, we will step you through making 3D perspective plots and animations of your final results!\n\n## Details\n\nFrom processing raster grids and vector data (points, lines, polygons) to creating visually appealing maps in different projection systems, the [Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt/) is a swiss army knife collection of open source tools used by Earth, Ocean and Planetary scientists worldwide. [PyGMT](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/pygmt) is a more user-friendly, Pythonic interface to GMT 6's modern execution mode that integrates well with the [PyData](https://pydata.org/) stack. This includes reading [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) arrays, [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) tables and [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) grids, plus support for rich display in interactive [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook environments. It is also a powerful library used for processing geospatial and geophysical datasets, including operations like sampling, filtering, interpolation and so on.\n\n### Skill level\n\n**Intermediate**\n\nThis workshop is intended for people with some previous Python programming/GMT experience. We invite students and geoscientists working on any geo related fields (e.g. Earth Observation, Geophysical, Marine, Magnetic, Gravity, Planetary, etc) to join. We also welcome seasoned GMT veterans who would like to find out how the Python interface works with GMT 6's modern execution mode and people from the geospatial industry with some Python programming experience that would like to get to know what PyGMT can do for parts of their geoprocessing workflow.\n\n### Things to bring and stuff to do beforehand\n\nA github repository containing jupyter notebooks for the workshop will be set up prior to the workshop. Users should only need to have a laptop with a modern browser that can launch an online [Pangeo Binder](https://binder.pangeo.io/) link/[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) Jupyter computing environment.

      "description": "A series of OGC Interoperability Experiments (IEs) have been working on techniques and technologies for the problem of linking multi-disciplinary and multi-organisation environmental data _without_ transferring data custody or maintenance responsibilities. These IEs, such as the [Second Environmental Linked Features Interoperability Experiment](https://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/initiatives/selfie) (SELFIE), are firmly grounded in W3C and OGC [best practices for spatial data on the web](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/). They involve organisations from New Zealand and around the world, trying to find solutions to problems such as: sharing data for transnational groundwater monitoring; linking descriptions of things to related things (e.g. boreholes to aquifers); using [popular vocabularies](https://schema.org/) to semantically describe the properties of things while avoiding misinterpretation; describing links between distributed records for things that change in nature over time and space; for data publishers to associate related information maintained by third parties to their own data; and maybe even the [HTTPRange-14 problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPRange-14). This workshop will first give an overview of **distributed and linked data** concepts: focusing on: why it matters for those responsible for publishing geospatial data; the advantages for those consuming geospatial data; and how search engines get involved. The SELF Interoperability Experiment will be discussed as an example. Then (and for most of the available time) we will work collaboratively to draft the publication of some spatial data using our laptops, taking advantage of these concepts in a way that will not alienate modern web developers or GIS practictioners, i.e. by using JSON-LD, semantic HTML, Web Components, and an implementation of the OGC WFS 3.0 specification for features.\n\n## Details\n\n## Learning outcomes\r\n\r\n1. I understand what structured and linked data are.\r\n2. I understand some benefits of structured/linked data.\r\n3. I am aware of the OGC/W3C Best Practices for Spatial Data on the Web.\r\n4. I know how to implement some of the Best Practices.\r\n5. I understand, can re-state, and (perhaps) respond to some of the challenges, limitations, and criticisms of structured/linked data\r\n\r\n### Note\r\n\r\nParticipants will be asked to optionally provide some sample data that may be suitable for publication using linked data concepts. Data from two domains that have a topological relationship are good candidates. If some interesting data are made available with sufficient time, the practical part of the workshop will be geared towards exploring that data. If not, some sample data will be used, at my (the presenter's) discretion.\r\n\r\nI do expect you to do some \"course reading\" to gain a some conceptual understanding. Reading is food for the brain. Here are some foundational documents, in priority order.\r\n\r\n- [Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/), W3C Working Group Note\r\n- [Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData), Tim Berners-Lee\r\n- [Background to the (first) Environmental Linked Features Interoperability Experiment (ELFIE)](https://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/initiatives/elfie)\r\n- [Creating semantic sites with Web Components and JSON-LD](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/creating-semantic-sites-with-web-components-and-jsonld)\r\n- [Building JSON-LD APIs: Best Practices](https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-api-best-practices/), W3C Draft Community Group Report\r\n- [GraphDB: Introduction to the Semantic Web](http://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/standard/introduction-to-semantic-web.html) (Note: this is more advanced, and largely beyond the scope of the workshop. The intention is to get you thinking wide as well as narrow.)\r\n\r\nHowever, don't stress! There will be no test. If, after doing some reading, you still don't understand the point of any of it, that's fine. There will be plenty of opportunities for discussion.\r\n\r\nThere *was* (and, to some extent, *still is*) a lot of misplaced hype about Linked Data out there in the untamed wildernesses of the Internet. Don't worry, I haven't drunk of the Semantic Kool Aid. This workshop will be reined in to practical applications rather than pure aspiration. You will come away thinking critically about these Linked Data ideas, perhaps seeded by some contrary opinions and writings by people who have/had their heads firmly screwed on:\r\n\r\n- [Two Bit History: Semantic Web](https://twobithistory.org/2018/05/27/semantic-web.html)\r\n- [Cory Doctorow: Metacrap](https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm)\r\n- [Aaron Swartz: A Programmable Web](https://archive.org/details/AaronSwartzAProgrammableWeb) (Note: this is a longer read than the others, but lighter and very interesting.)\n\n### Skill level\n\n**Intermediate**\n\nParticipants need to understand web development principles and various technologies and standards underpinning the web. If you've done some web development, or if some of these terms are vaguely registering, then we're good to go:\r\n\r\n- Semantic HTML\r\n- Linked data, RDF\r\n- JSON (perhaps JSON-LD)\r\n- HTTP REST\r\n- OGC WFS 2 and/or 3\r\n- Vocabularies/ontologies\r\n- SEO\r\n- Web Components\n\n### Things to bring and stuff to do beforehand\n\nDetails will be sent out closer to the time, but the basics are:\r\n- A well oiled brain (i.e. please do some reading)\r\n- A laptop with a web browser (Chrome or Firefox preferred)\r\n- Ideally a running instance of https://github.com/geopython/pygeoapi (I'm willing to help you set this up in the days and weeks leading up to the workshop if necessary)",

It was felt that there was too much overhead involved in supporting a marginally different profile and that reliance on international guidance was a better path. This decision created problems on both sides of the Tasman due to slow international adoption of the new standard.  In New Zealand, where the tool sets most commonly used do not support the new standard, it was not adopted. In Australia, it was adopted but in different ways by different agencies which rather negates the value of a standard.\r\n\r\nNow ICSM and ANZLIC have stepped up and are creating the needed guidance and support for ISO19115-1.

This was part of a wider scheme of developing some national transport access measures with a focus on improving access to the transport system. MRCagney worked collaboratively with NZTA to develop and implement a methodology to measure access to public transport in the major cities of Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.\r\n\r\nThe measure we computed for NZTA was based on walking catchments to stops and stations that meet a certain threshold relating to ‘frequent’ services across the full public transport networks in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. This is a way of quantifying access to public transport that goes beyond simple proximity to bus stops. To do this task, we used entirely open source tools, including Python, Open Street Map, General Transit Feed Specification and GeoPandas. In my talk, I will explain our approach, tools and results. In particular, I want to share our experiences of:\r\n\r\n- General Transit Feed Specification data\r\n- Pros and cons of using an API to compute walking catchments\r\n- Communicating with our client as we came across challenges with the approach\r\n\r\nBy working closely with our client at NZTA, we were able to develop a methodology using FOSS4G to measure access to public transport across the full Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch regions. The key metric we provided to NZTA was, for each city, the proportion of the population within walking distance of frequent public transport. Using Folium, we created interactive maps to enable NZTA to review the catchments for each region, to identify which areas have walking access to frequent public transport. For stops or stations that did not meet the frequency threshold, we created maps that NZTA could use to understand why they were excluded.\r\n\r\nThe outputs were well received by NZTA and have been included in their reporting of national transport access measures. We are excited to explore the potential to further develop this measure to better understand issues around equity of access to public transport for different user groups.",

The assumption by environmental specialists is that developments up on the upper and middle water catchments in Apia (which includes clearing of land, vegetation, farming, buildings and roads) is contributing to the continual and now more frequent, intense and damaging flash floods. On 27th February 2018, the UNDP Multi-Country Office in Samoa contracted SkyEye to undertake mapping and assessment of the impacts of Cyclone Gita and changes in terrain, vegetation, developed areas in four of the urban water catchment areas since 2015.  The results of the assessment will help inform the Post Disaster Rapid Assessment led by the Samoa Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE). Specifically, SkyEye was to deliver three key products: Provide High-Resolution Spatial Imagery and Maps of the four Watershed Catchment areas, Provide a Report detailing the spatial imagery and an assessment of damage to assess aspects of the environment and Provide GIS training for relevant staff of MNRE. Between March and April 2018, SkyEye captured, mapped, digitised and assessed the state of changes in the environment totalling 57.91 km² across four Water Catchment Areas in North Upolu. The geospatial images captured were assessed against imagery from 2015 provided by MNRE.\r\n\r\n## Ala Addressing System - Solving the problem of no street addresses in Samoa\r\n\r\nHow QGIS contributed to solving the problem of a lack of street addresses in Samoa. Finding places/addresses is really difficult because Samoa, like other Pacific Islands, does not have an official addressing system. So we came up with a solution to address this problem. The project involved creating 823 2 km² Grids covering all of Samoa's Landmass. We created 2 m² grids within each 2 km² grid. The 2 m² grids were used to create centroids with a geometry attribute (x, y coordinate). This coordinate represented what's called an \"Ala Number\" which can be identified as an individual's/family's address (e.g. Ala Number 23-2-345 (Grid 23 - Column 2 - Row 345). The purpose of this project is to provide a logical and localised addressing system for Samoa and hopefully the Pacific; to allow for easy addressing for Pacific Islanders on the global market; and help improve government services and project implementation. There was a need to develop this system now, or else Samoa would miss out on possible future developments. The system is currently being integrated into an app we recently launched called Maua (Samoa’s first e-commerce platform). The idea is to hopefully have this system become Samoa’s official addressing system. It is currently in the talks as SkyEye is one of the committee members for Developing Samoa’s official addressing system.",

We will present you a challenging project we have about mapping accessibility for disabled people, made with disabled people. We want to support urban planning, foster active mobility and support a strategy for an adapted tourism. Our main challenge: how to make people and local communities seize the potential of OSM and take part in this ecosystem (at present our group is made up mainly of metropolitans). Our metric for success: OSM contributions are easy to understand for anyone, including the disadvantaged, and the local national geographic institute shares their data into OSM and are willing to work with this ecosystem.",

      "description": "Routine scientific analysis tasks should be perfectly reproducible, like a pure function: the same output for the same input, and without modifying the input data. This must apply across different computers. If this is not achieved, the result is potentially unverifiable. In addition, it should be possible to rapidly iterate ideas and formulæ as part of a semi-interactive process of experimentation (and debugging). Finally, we should ensure the whole thing is easily put under collaborative version control.\r\n\r\nFor some time I have been working with a workflow that I have found very useful to achieve these outcomes. It is primarily a combination of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for containerisation and management of dependencies) and [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (for launching multi-step workflows with a complex dependency graph). In this lightning talk, I will outline this workflow. Hopefully you will be left with ideas about how you can make your computational process for geo-scientific exploration more resilient, whether or not you use Docker or Make.",

      "description": "The development of free and open-source routing software has led to an increased usage of path-finding and route analysis in novel and niche applications. pgRouting is an extension of PostgreSQL and PostGIS that provides several algorithms that are dedicated to solving geospatial routing problems, including All Pairs Short Path, Bi-directional Dijkstra, A*, and several others. pgRouting finds paths based on dynamic costs and is thus generalisable to any path or network topology. Although pgRouting has seen many niche applications, such as emergency routes in the face of natural disasters or routing for specialized shipping vehicles with complex turn and road restrictions, a vast majority are based on human transit and routing within cities. Applications of pgRouting to model movements of animal species are essentially non-existent. Yet, these can provide an interesting case study of the power of pgRouting to model movement and in route discovery. Such use-cases are particularly informative about the migration behaviour of species and have a very large application in the field of ecology and behavioural biology. A significant challenge of this application is that most natural environments lack “roads” or other features that can be utilised as a network topology along which routes are found. This presentation introduces developments that are being made to generalise route network creation in natural environments and demonstrates the application of pgRouting in describing the movements of fishes in the Samoan mangrove-seagrass-reef seascape.",

      "description": "### Overview\r\n\r\nProviding the Antarctic policy community, the tools and knowledge to support environmental management is critical for both the health of the Antarctic environment but also the Antarctic Treaty itself. Using OSS, Manaaki Whenua has developed the Antarctic Data Analysis (ADA) tool to provide context to, and assist, the Antarctic Policy community in the planning, permitting, and implementation of Antarctic activities. ADA eliminates the need for desktop geographic information system software or advanced technical expertise, by processing and presenting data in an easy to use way. This results in a site that allows users to discover, query and visualise spatial and temporal data relating to how Antarctica is changing. \r\n\r\n### Users\r\n\r\nThe tool was primarily built for environmental managers, and parties to the Antarctic Treaty and the Committee for Environmental Protection. The tool has been developed with input from the Antarctic Policy community and we expect that the tool will be utilised to support the conservation and management of the Antarctic continent. The site provides the users with maps and data illustrating various aspects of the continent, including facilities, environmental management, biogeography, human activity, climate, and geology.  \r\n\r\n### Interaction and design\r\n\r\nThe map (OpenLayers 4/Mapserver/Mapcache) is supplemented by controls that enable querying at a single location, comparison between two locations, or along a transect line. These queries are based on a server-side API service, using NodeJS, that allows the user to query of all the terrestrial data within the tool. Non-spatial data is visualised using D3JS, which provide a range of charts and graphs that are built dynamically.\r\nThe technical approach used to visualise spatial data within the tool varies with the type of data being visualised. For example, a series of hexbin maps display human activity data. They are created dynamically (per zoom scale and per year) in the application using OpenLayers as the user interacts with the map with a time slider. \r\nTo support the primary users (Antarctic environmental managers) to discover information about a location and how it is changing over time, a \"Query Builder\" was built which poses a series of queries which the user may be interested in. These queries create a “path” through the website as a series of steps, supporting the users to enable them to discover the answer to their question but at the same time helping them to learn how to use the application.\r\n\r\n### Future\r\n\r\nThe ADA tool was presented at the recent Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting and will continue to be developed to support new knowledge on how the continent will change. The site builds upon a range of existing web sites such as the Antarctic Environments Portal, Our Environment, S-map Online, and the New Zealand Soils Portal. These sites were designed, created and are maintained by the Informatics Team at Manaaki Whenua.",

By integrating SBT and ICT tools, with national disaster risk management architecture, timely and accurate information can be delivered to relevant communities, individuals, rescuers and decision makers to save lives and properties at risk. The project was funded by the Japanese Fund for Poverty Reduction, with technical assistance from the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, Asia Institute of Technology Geomatics Centre, Asian Disaster Reduction Centre, Remote Sensing Technology Centre and Geothings. \r\n\r\nWork carried out was divided into 5 sections:\r\n1. Local communities digitised building and infrastructure in Open Street Map\r\n2. Local communities with assistance from mobile app developers designed a base map to fit the purpose of the project. These include building attributes, conditions, height and materials. \r\n3. Recording capacities: using a geobinning app, disaster capacities and vulnerability are identified and mapped out in real time. Community hazard maps were generated out of this work. \r\n4. Recording: during a disaster, users can record information including disaster situation, building damage, and needs assessments. This information is sent to the operation centre for assistance, all in real time. \r\n5. Emergency Observation: using satellite data, and the community base map, it was possible to estimate damage extents.\r\n\r\nLocal communities were trained to use the tools to record flood- and cyclone-related vulnerabilities and capacities in villages. All these tools and reports are updated on the website monitored by the NDMO Operations Centre. Two critical maps came out of this work: 1. Community-based hazard map, and; 2. Evacuation map. These are the base map used for the village to seek shelter and identify hazard areas and planning.",

It is the use of coordinates and the consequent implicit spatial relationships between features which define GIS. However coordinate reference systems can be hard to understand. Confusion is exacerbated in modern times when users have as ready access to global coordinate reference systems such as WGS84, as they do to local systems such as NZGD2000 (New Zealand Geodetic Datum 2000). These have quite different characteristics and spatial errors of up to a metre can be incurred if they are confused. Furthermore, the relationship between them is not constant – it is a function of time. New Zealand straddles the boundary of the Pacific and Australian plates and is continuously deforming, so the time dependency of coordinates and coordinate transformations is particularly complex. This presentation uses the development and maintenance of NZGD2000 as a case study to examine the need for and challenges of time-dependent coordinate transformations.",

In order to collaboratively define how map-based tools can address specific community perspectives, the Geospatial Research Institute (University of Canterbury) engaged key community representatives of the two case studies, establishing partnership frameworks for the implementation of the research project. The map-based tools intend to support better integration of mātauranga Māori in town planning and aim at enabling whanau to document and share their traditional narratives and lived experiences to engage the communities in the creation of a shared vision for the regeneration of their villages. The pilot is being co-designed to promote the development of cultural mapping by the whanau, the primary end-users of the tools, connecting the stories and cultural layers to whenua. During the development of the map-based tools, it is imperative to maintain an iterative and active communication with the community partners to continue integrating their views at all levels, to ensure that the user experience reflects their tikanga and ways of knowing. The two map-based tools are being developed in Django, orchestrating the open-source database system extended with spatial capabilities PostgreSQL/PostGIS, the spatial data server GeoServer, the mapping API OpenLayers for interactive maps, and the JavaScript framework Vue.js for reactive user interfaces. Given the public nature of the project, the rationale for using open source technology is primarily to minimise the costs of implementation of the map-based tools, envisioning the free ongoing use of the applications by rūnanga and other small to medium-sized communities. The map-based tools are being developed with Māori for Māori communities, fostering ownership, belonging and self-determination.",

      "description": "As one of the world’s most ecologically diverse countries, Australia has experienced rapid changes as a result of human pressures and is particularly vulnerable to climate change.  With a land area of over 7,000,000 km<sup>2</sup>, understanding the state and condition of this ever-changing environment and identifying options for future management remains a significant challenge. \r\n\r\nHow can we monitor the health of our environment and how it’s changing over time? What action can or should we take? How do we tell if measures to improve our environment are working as expected? These are some of the problems we are addressing with our new land cover classification and change detection system. Based on open Earth Observation (EO) satellite imagery, and building on existing open source software, this system will enable us to understand how our environment has changed over the past 30 years and guide in our decision making going into the future. \r\n\r\nDigital Earth Australia (DEA), powered by the Open Data Cube (ODC), offers a framework for continuous land monitoring using earth observation data to produce a range of open access land products targeted to decision-makers, practitioners and scientists. At Geoscience Australia we are collaborating with partners to build on this innovative framework and create an open source library which generates consistent land cover classification and change maps based on the Food and Agriculture Organisation’s (FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS). The system builds on, contributes to and feeds back to other projects and research undertaken in Europe. Its development within the ODC environment will facilitate its use in countries or regions that are adopting this technology.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will cover how we’re bringing all this together, and what makes our approach stand out from the crowd. It will also go into some of the challenges we’ve had with implementing land cover classification at scale, and how Open Street Maps came to our rescue! And finally, where to next? Why we’re excited to integrate this into Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) reporting, and other future applications.",

One such dataset is the Fiji Building outline database. This database potentially holds all building outlines, building construction material and building function. Following TC Winston in 2016 it became apparent that Fiji needed better geospatial data to plan and respond to such natural disasters.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, the University of the South Pacific Geospatial Science students undertook an assessment of the Fiji Building Outline Database on Open Street Maps. As a result, we were able to determine there were still substantial areas of Fiji with no building outline data.\r\n\r\nIn August 2019 UNITAR-UNOSAT together with the University of the South Pacific (USP) and the Fiji Government conducted a Mapathon at the USP Lower Campus in Suva from 26th-28th.  Named \"Fiji Missing Maps 2019\", UNOSAT arranged for an experienced mapathon expert from OSM Asia Pacific Office in Indonesia to facilitate the event. Through this capacity development initiative, the OSM expert also conducted training of trainers for local mapping champions, equipping them to operate future Mapathons.\r\n\r\nThe Mapathon was promoted via the Missing Maps Website. Participants included Geospatial Science students from USP who acted as lab demonstrators to help members of the public and government officers.  Particularly pleasing was the international response with volunteers from all over the world adding to the OSM Building Outline Database.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will cover our experiences and the results of Fiji Missing Maps 2019.",

Geologists require the ability to assess multiple data sets and QGIS gives them the ability to do this. Being able to bring satellite imagery directly into your map window has been a major advance in the interpretation of geological data. Plugins allow for remote sensing data to be sourced, processed and presented as required by the user. Other plugins allow drill holes to be plotted in plan and in cross-section. The use of free open source symbols and patterns has extended the capabilities of geologist to produce presentation quality maps. Many geologists work as individual consultants or contractors and the open source world is a fantastic resource of software to allow them to do their work without the constricting licensing conditions or software costs.",

      "description": "Earlier this year, Joseph Elfelt of Mapping Support published an amazing resource: a text file listing over 1800 public US geospatial data sources. Covering federal, state, and city agencies, the file effectively pointed to hundreds of thousands of publicly accessible authoritative geospatial data layers. On the surface, this looked like a massive win for open data advocates.\r\n\r\nA closer look, though, leads to a more sobering conclusion. First and foremost, the sources are all public ArcGIS Servers, with some occasional public data portals thrown in. Most of these servers contain poorly titled data intended for internal, not public, usage. It's common for agencies to change URLs, or delete the server without warning. HTTPS isn't uniform. And it’s a server. It's a far cry from open and accessible data.\r\n\r\nWhere portals are used, they generally haven’t changed or improved in the last six years, despite rapid developments elsewhere in the geospatial industry. Metadata publication in portals is inconsistent. Raster imagery often isn’t supported. Service levels are unreliable. Licensing is absent, contradictory, or \"pretty legal\".\r\n \r\nData publishing is clearly an afterthought for most agencies, and standards are persistently, frustratingly low. Why is this still the case, well over a decade into the open data movement? In this talk, I'll build on the work of the Civil Analytics Network at Harvard University to point out some of the annoyances—major and minor—that are preventing agencies from publishing their open data to a professional standard. And I'll conclude by arguing that advocates need to keep pushing for better, and not just more, open data.",

      "description": "Geographic proximity to the locations of different community resources (e.g. GPs, supermarkets, and schools) affects public health and welfare in both positive and negative ways, for example reducing social isolation or increasing the risk of obesity. Close proximity to community resources provides easier and more direct opportunities to perform daily tasks, such as shop, meet friends, or see a GP. Time and financial costs of access are also reduced, freeing them up for other uses. When linked to socioeconomic status, population density, and urban status, community resource accessibility analysis can support health policy and improve outcomes for individuals living in deprived areas.\r\n\r\nNeighbourhoods are the most commonly used unit of scale in community resource accessibility research, often taking the form of existing, outdated census units. But how representative of the people living within them are they? Issues arise when trying to generalise results to different groups of people living nearby each other, such as the Modifiable Area Unit Problem (MAUP) or the \"Local Trap\".\r\n\r\nRoad network analysis is used to perform community resource accessibility analysis with the assumption that individuals always use cars as their transport method, but what about people that don’t have access to a car, can’t drive, or prefer other modes of transport? By understanding transport choices of individuals, community resource accessibility can be assessed through a different lens by including pedestrian or public transport routes, or limiting maximum search distance to a reasonable walking distance.\r\n\r\nCrowdsourcing neighbourhood data from people living in them can create more representative areas and allow for neighbourhood delineation to be explored based on personal characteristics of individuals. To crowdsource neighbourhood data, open source code and tools were used to create a user-friendly website to crowdsource neighbourhood data from the general public in Wellington.\r\n\r\nA range of repositories of open source data were used to collect locations of different types of community resources, such as schools, primary healthcare facilities, and food retailers. Using these, analysis was performed using a range of Python packages (including geopandas and pandana) to compare community defined neighbourhoods to existing spatial units in terms of spatial properties and access to different community resources.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will cover current progress of this master’s project and our next steps.",

The data extends over 70 years, from the 1920s through to the mid-1990s. This archive represents an important resource for understanding Australia’s changing landscape as the majority of the collection predates high resolution satellite imagery.\r\n\r\nDigitisation of this archive is an ongoing priority as some of the original negatives are now very old and starting to degrade, but the approximately 280,000 images digitised so far are currently difficult to discover and access.\r\n\r\nSimilar but smaller archives of aerial photography are maintained by various state government agencies, and some are quite mature in their adoption of digital discovery and access, however, each agency has implemented their own system, generally locked to a proprietary platform with little capacity for federating data across agencies.\r\n\r\nGA has therefore partnered with Data-61 under the Platforms for Open Data (PfOD) program to design and build a canonical metadata repository for images in the collection, and an open API for discovering and eventually accessing these images.  The project has a strong focus on open source and standards-based solutions, with the hope that state government agencies will come on board, facilitating federated discovery of imagery across state and federally managed archives.\r\n\r\nThe project is a fascinating example of old technology meeting new, dealing with metadata sourced from nearly century-old hand-written documents on the one hand, and the latest cloud deployment technologies and emerging API standards for geospatial data discovery on the other.",

      "description": "As a community-driven project, OpenStreetMap (OSM) provides mapping guidelines and a Wiki where the community agrees on certain mapping norms. These norms are, however, only recommendations and there is no mechanism that enforces the contributors to comply with them. Contributors' edits may not follow these mapping guidelines, and local communities often deviate from the best practices. While this provides freedom in the collection of diverse geographical knowledge, it also makes it hard to assure a high-quality dataset of homogeneous quality — and hence usability. This is particularly important with guidelines focusing on the way how objects should be represented and mutually related, rather than what to collect and not to collect. The correction of the edits not following community standards is, in turn, also carried out by the community of contributors, who may have difficulties finding OSM features that need to be corrected. While quality assurance tools (e.g. Keep Right, Osmose) assist with this task, they only capture a subset of the community standards and do so inconsistently.\r\n\r\nHere, we explore an approach to using data-mining methods to automatically learn prevalent patterns in the representation of certain classes of spatial objects. The underlying assumption of this data-driven approach is that the majority of objects in the dataset are mapped correctly. From these patterns, we learn rules that enable to identify outliers -- potential errors in OSM data. For example, if the majority of bridges in the dataset are crossing something (likely an obstacle), then this pattern can be adapted as a rule. Thus, if there are some bridges that are not crossing any other objects, they would be seen as potentially erroneous and should be inspected. Expert contributors may then assess these objects, and make corrections if necessary.\r\n\r\nApart from analyzing patterns in well known topological relations between spatial objects such as disjoint, crosses, and meets, we have investigated patterns in ternary spatial relations which are not commonly considered. In particular, the connectedness of a linear object on both sides (e.g. a road bridge should be connected to roads on both sides), and betweenness of spatial objects (e.g. an alleyway should be in between properties). These spatial relations pose interesting problems in terms of how they can be modelled, represented, and reasoned about.\r\n\r\nWe present the results of our studies using frequent pattern mining on data in Victoria, Australia, and are keen to discuss with the community candidate features that would assist to better identify corrections to the OSM dataset.",

      "description": "Changes and treatments to New Zealand’s roads occur daily. However, there is no central register to record changes.\r\n\r\nA New Zealand agency needed to identify curves in roads that had been classified as a danger and determine if they had been adjusted. A novel approach was needed given the lack of data recorded. \r\n\r\nOrbica was supplied with a dataset (oocc – out of context curves) that showed all curves along all New Zealand roads. We narrowed the dataset to “not acceptable” and “not desirable” curves for state highways and used Open Street Map (OSM) to find out if the roads had been modified or treated (i.e. had changed from a curve to straight). The key difficulty was determining whether the changes in OSM were made for aesthetic reasons (i.e. to tidy features) or because an actual road treatment had taken place. There are thousands of OSM edits, and we needed a way to define them. \r\n\r\nTo do this, we used the oocc dataset to extract the segment (or curves) from the 2017 OSM dataset and the 5/2019 OSM dataset. We matched the curves, then calculated attributes to describe the relationship between the old curve and the new curve. We then developed a Deep Neural Network AI model to predict (based on attributes) which were aesthetic changes, and which were due to road changes/treatments. \r\n\r\nThe model produced about 30 curves, of which 20 were real road changes. We also assessed changes in speed, so the total number of treated curves (including speed changes) for the period 2017-2019, was 219.\r\n\r\nWe used PostgreSQL and python to achieve this and mapped the results with GeoServer and Mapbox.\r\n\r\nThis represents a novel and innovative approach, using opensource technology, to identify road treatments.",

      "description": "New Zealand Transport Agency’s (NZTA) Crash Analysis System (CAS) contains almost 1.5 million crash records with hundreds of attributes that describe when, where and how a crash occurs. Orbica and partner company Catalyst were tasked by NZTA to develop a user-friendly web application to live stream the database so that transport planners and engineers (with no prerequisite knowledge of SQL) could easily build complex stacked spatial and aspatial queries with drag-and-drop, ease of use and intuitive controls.\r\n\r\nNZTA, a central government agency, accepted our proposal to design the solution completely using opensource technology.\r\n\r\nThe following components and corresponding APIs were built for CAS: \r\n- A React, Leaflet and WebGL based front-end \r\n- A PostgreSQL/PostGIS and SQL Server spatial-based geospatial database \r\n- PHP, SilverStripe, web socket-based layer for data streaming\r\n\r\nOrbica mixed and tweaked several existing Leaflet plugins to create comprehensive modular components for the GIS aspects of the CAS solution. Main features included:\r\n- A fully “edit geometry” standardised plugin including the following:\r\n  - `Leaflet.FreeDraw` \r\n  - `Leaflet.draw `\r\n  - Specific business editing functionalities\r\n\r\nThis works in conjunction with:\r\n- Map data visualisation: crash feature results from queries are displayed as heatmaps, cluster view and PIXI/WebGl specific visualisations capable of handling millions of features (business requirement functionality).\r\n- Schematic/mapping data visualisation: collision diagram. We created a dedicated 2D graphic system based on an opensource web data visualisation framework (PIXI.js WebGl framework).\r\n\r\nRelevant features/components will be shared with the open-source community soon.\r\n\r\nCAS has been successfully deployed and the road safety community is using it to output complex collision diagrams and reports to help them target and advocate for road safety improvements, as well as store and share queries with other road safety practitioners.\r\n\r\nNZTA is now investing in opensource technologies for new projects. This adoption represents a significant growing confidence in the robustness of opensource technologies from the government sector.",

      "description": "Maps often show a simplified view of the world in order to highlight a single issue. Real-life, on the other hand, is messy, contradictory and multifaceted. This means there are always alternative ways to visualise geospatial data, and our choice of which facets to highlight within the data has political implications. Sometimes showing diversity means embracing complexity, and oversimplification leads to an illusion of homogeneity.\r\n\r\nIn real life, I’m a first-generation immigrant to Australia. Like all immigrants, I’m constantly haunted by anxieties and self-doubts about media portrayal, public perception, cultural identity and issues of belonging. Luckily I do data visualisation for a living, and I believe that facts can be the best therapist. Naturally, I’ve made maps to answer some of my very personal questions, make sense of the world around me, and bring to light data which is obscured by other maps that I see.\r\nIn this talk, I’d like to cover:\r\n\r\n- Mapping techniques that convey the richness of human data: dot-density maps ([where do people come from](https://smallmultiples.com.au/articles/the-languages-we-speak-in-sydney--melbourne/), [who did they vote for](https://smallmultiples.com.au/projects/australian-election-results-one-dot-for-every-vote/)), and using edible media for maps ([chocolate](https://notasingleorigin.com/))\r\n- A number of mapping projects that provide unique perspectives on multicultural Australia\r\n- Using open access data to answer very personal questions and raise public awareness\r\n\r\nThe goal of my talk is to encourage people to appreciate the beauty of complexity, and its importance in the field of cartography. Maps can help us see the unpredictability of the individual and the permeability of the group at local and national scales.",

      "description": "QGIS started back in 2002 as a simple hobby project with only a handful of developers and a small user base. Since then, it has grown into one of the most popular cross-platform open source spatial desktop tools available, with an ever-growing developer and user base, widely used in many sectors, even as a full replacement for commercial offerings.  This growth has not come without cost or growing pains to the project and community. A growing user base and an ongoing effort to be taken as a serious alternative to commercial offerings have led to a shift in developer and user expectations for the project. \r\n\r\nAs QGIS has grown into areas and user bases the early developers never dreamed of, some of the feelings the project had have changed, and this might have zapped some of the fun.  Was this inevitable, as we pushed the project with more and more features and promotion in the spatial community?  How do you maintain the same feel for the project, while at the same time becoming more serious?\r\n\r\nWhat about the users and the community?  Have their expectations now changed for the project? At what point did we notice a change in the community and the levels of service we were required to live up to?\r\n\r\nLong-term-release, better build process, better documentation, UI translations into many languages; these all make great software, but at a cost for a mostly volunteer-run project. When does the project switch from pure volunteer to a more commercial entity?",

      "description": "The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) is an archipelago located in the Pacific Ocean that is home to several globally endangered wildlife species.  In order to provide the best management and conservation of these species, CNMI Division of Fish and Wildlife (DFW) biologists regularly collect population data through various field surveys.  In the past, these surveys were conducted using paper field forms that would be manually entered into databases while spatial data was collected using handheld GPS units.  Recently, DFW has moved towards automating data collection and management using free and open source solutions in order to reduce paper buildup, minimise data entry error, and generally streamline operations.  This presentation will outline the workflow and process that the CNMI DFW has implemented for near-seamless integration of field data into spatial and tabular databases.  Rugged field tablets are fitted with custom-built Python applications (using PyQT GUI) that are used to document wildlife surveys while open source GIS software (Intramaps Roam) is used for field navigation and mapping needs. Output are then synchronised to a local server where they are programmatically subset and shuttled to appropriate directories for future analysis and summarisation. Utilising these open source solutions provides a fast and efficient flow of data collection and management with the flexibility of specialised functionality required to survey species within the CNMI.",

      "description": "In 1835, the HMS Beagle arrived at the Galapagos Islands, igniting a new era of science and history. This voyage was the dawn of island biogeography, the study of the spatial distribution of species and ecosystems across time. This voyage also harboured unintended consequences: a virgin ecosystem on an originally unpopulated archipelago only a few hundred years ago, the Galapagos Islands in 2019 are home to a growing population of 35,000 people and host 275,000 tourists a year.  Just as this area is a hotspot for studying biodiversity and biogeography, there is also a unique chance to map and analyze human and urban geography. 184 years after Charles Darwin, students from the University of Chicago joined a project led by the Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation to map the urban landscape with Mapillary, using 360-degree cameras. \r\n\r\nMachine learning, computer vision, and geospatial analysis allow imagery to become data about levels of urbanization. While the Galapagos Islands offer one insight, many other islands across the world demonstrate the potential to study their unique patterns of urban development, including the vast array of populated islands in the Pacific region and beyond. What kind of urban challenges can street-level imagery solve in isolated island environments? What kind of data can OpenStreetMap derive from island imagery? What do automated detections in the images tell us about growth and change?\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, we’ll take a visual journey using Mapillary imagery across many islands of the world: from the Galapagos and Santa Catalina Island to the Faroe and Canary Islands; from Réunion and Zanzibar in the Indian Ocean to Singapore and Tasmania; from Cuba and Guadalupe to Hawaii and Iceland.",

Tasks such as creating and maintaining virtual machines and servers, understanding, installing and configuring open source applications, building data exchange pipelines, backup processes and security hardening, are daunting and often beyond the everyday realities of working inside smaller institutions and organisations.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, an open source GIS deployment unlocks an innovation potential usually inaccessible when dealing with licensing fees and a lack of control over proprietary technology. As a globally recognised leader in open source technologies, Catalyst is committed to helping organisations in their transition to open source GIS. We have created a managed GIS platform to simplify FOSS adoption while keeping in full control over your GIS back-end applications.\r\n\r\nThis talk focusses on how embracing open source technology has given two New Zealand Territorial Authorities the freedom to innovate delivery and improvement of their geospatial data and services. Using examples from production systems across New Zealand we look at how both authorities have created public data portals, dashboards, web mapping applications, and achieved direct integration with external data sources. All while improving reliability and scalability of their underlying GIS systems and data stores. We explore how, by removing the barriers of proprietary licensing, open source fosters local and global collaboration, enables local communities, and allows local government to reinvest licensing cost in research, development and their communities.",
